There are two types of configurations - static and dynamic. Static configurations are defined in files or environment variables, requiring restarting app server to take effect, whereas dynamic configurations are defined in databases and updates take effect immediately.

Dynamic configs are managed using REST [configuration api](../api-config/).

::: warning Why Dynamic Configs?
Dynamic configs are needed in cases such as
  <ul>
  <li>to allow define service-specific configs such as message templates</li>
  <li>in a multi-node deployment, configs can be generated by one node (typically master) and shared with other nodes</li>
  </ul>
